          <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>R V Coding Club was started in the year 2016 by six students from the ECE department with an aim of bridging the gap between the departments when it comes to competitive coding. Then known as InSYNC, the R V Coding Club bloomed from a small team of 10 individuals to a capacity of over 60 students today, spanning across the branches of CSE, ISE, ECE, EEE and Mechanical among others</p>

        <q>"Having the opportunity to coach new students on the classes I've already taken has been a huge help for me both in terms of reviewing what I know and also developing my ability to communicate technical concepts. I think the format really fosters the type of long-term commitment necessary to really master a programming language.".</q>
